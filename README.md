# RunCommandAPIEndpointt
This is a portion of a server management product I'm working on. This is a "fork" of [RunCommandAPIEndpoint](https://github.com/icepaq/RunCommandAPIEndpoint)

This reason I have released the code for this project is because this software is intended to be installed on the customer's server. The customer should have the option to install directly from the source for security purposes.
